This extension just moves a small snippet of text from one point of a set of web pages (stereogum.com Number Ones reviews) to another part of the same page.

The extension doesn't transmit any information from any electronic devices to any others.

The extension doesn't require any kind of registration to be used. It doesn't care who uses it.

No PII is collected at any time.

If the extension does not see the expected input text, it bails out with a message to the browser's log console. It tries not to remove other text accidentally.

Of course, any user of this extension assumes the usual liability.
